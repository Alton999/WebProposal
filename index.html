      <h3 id="topic">The topic</h3>
      <p>The Australian wildlife has been degrading for as long as humans have been on this planet. Although due to the increasing population there is no possible way for us to completely save the Earth and its animals from degrading but we CAN build awareness on how to reduce pollution and further damages to the wildlife. These wildlife organisations are necessary to build a future where humans can live in harmony with nature. In Australia there are many threats to our current ecosystem such as pollution, bushfires and reef and coral damages. All of these issues have grave impacts on our current habitats and natural wildlifes for generations to come. With this said the purpose of this website would be to raise awareness and build the concern for <strong>our</strong> environment especially with the younger generations.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>The <strong>AWC</strong> -(Australian Wildlife Conservatory) is currently the largest private owner and manager of land of conservation in Australia. They are strong believers that currently the ways Australia is managing wildlife conservations is inadequte and they are developing and implementing a new model of conservation.</p>

      <h4>Target audience</h4>
			<p>Wildlife conservations should be a world wide topic however the issue now is that the urgency is not built as part of a culture in Australia currently. The main goal of this website would be to capture the attention of the younger generation especially youths <em>(Between the ages of 15-24)</em> and attempt to build the relationship between wildlife organisations and these people to build a better and brighter culture for the future.</p>
      <!-- Use the blockquote element if applicable -->
      <h4>Why this re-design is needed</h4>
      <p>Currently a lot of the wildlife conservatories including WWF and the current AWC websites are either too vague or too broad. There is no balance of information but for WWF's website it is far too cluttered with so many different topics being presented, which for their purpose would be good as they are targetting a wide range of audiences.And in the case of AWC there is a lack of vital information such as where people's donation money is going or even the main issues they are trying to solve!</p>
      <h4>User profile 1</h4>

        <li><strong>Favourite device:</strong> Laptop</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> High</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interview was held for the website of AWC. The first thing to note is that this particular user has a strong understanding and interest in animals and the natural wildlife however she has no relationship with any of the wildlife organisations. We were keen to find out why and how have these organisations missed this user. When this question was presented the answer was not surprising; she simply had not enough awareness of the direness of this situation. This brought up an interesting topic where when she browsed the website there was no call for action and had a poor navigation hierarchy and it seems informative but does not actually encourage anyone to help out. Instead it would be better to show something that is affecting her personally things such as what your donations can actually lead to or what impacts your donations currently have. </p>
			<blockquote>
        It would be great to show more community involvement rather than just money. Things such as volunteering opportunities or community dashboard would be a great start.
