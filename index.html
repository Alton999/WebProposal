      <h2>Background Research</h2>
      <!-- Still need to fix navbar and add more elements to subheaders -->
      <h3 id="topic">The topic</h3>
			<p>The Australian wildlife has been degrading for as long as humans have been on this planet. Although due to the increasing population there is no possible way for us to completely save the Earth and its animals from degrading but we CAN build awareness on how to reduce pollution and further damages to the wildlife. These wildlife organisations are necessary to build a future where humans can live in harmony with nature. In Australia there are many threats to our current ecosystem such as pollution, bushfires and reef and coral damages. All of these issues have grave impacts on our current habitats and natural wildlifes for generations to come. With this said the purpose of this website would be to raise awareness and build the concern for <strong>our</strong> environment especially with the younger generations.</p>
			<p>
				Right now those that are aware of the current issue of climate change, animal abuse and loss of habitats are older generations or those that are currently free from retirements. This is because most of these websites constantly ask for payments/donations and although this is an important aspect it does not build the culture for the early generations. With this we want to find a way to cater for the younger generations <strong>(youths)</strong>. This way we can peak the right curiousity in them early and hopefully it can carry down.
			</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>The <strong>AWC</strong> -(Australian Wildlife Conservatory) is currently the largest private owner and manager of land of conservation in Australia. They are strong believers that currently the ways Australia is managing wildlife conservations is inadequte and they are developing and implementing a new model of conservation.</p>

      <h4>Target audience</h4>
			<p>Wildlife conservations should be a world wide topic however the issue now is that the urgency is not built as part of a culture in Australia currently. The main goal of this website would be to capture the attention of the younger generation especially youths <em>(Between the ages of 15-24)</em> and attempt to build the relationship between wildlife organisations and these people to build a better and brighter culture for the future.</p>
      <!-- Use the blockquote element if applicable -->
      <h4>Why this re-design is needed</h4>
      <p>Currently a lot of the wildlife conservatories including WWF and the current AWC websites are either too vague or too broad. There is no balance of information but for WWF's website it is far too cluttered with so many different topics being presented, which for their purpose would be good as they are targetting a wide range of audiences.And in the case of AWC there is a lack of vital information such as where people's donation money is going or even the main issues they are trying to solve!</p>
      <h4>User profile 1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 19</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li>
        <li><strong>Favourite device:</strong> Laptop</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> High</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interview was held for the website of AWC. The first thing to note is that this particular user has a strong understanding and interest in animals and the natural wildlife however she has no relationship with any of the wildlife organisations. We were keen to find out why and how have these organisations missed this user. When this question was presented the answer was not surprising; she simply had not enough awareness of the direness of this situation. This brought up an interesting topic where when she browsed the website there was no call for action and had a poor navigation hierarchy and it seems informative but does not actually encourage anyone to help out. Instead it would be better to show something that is affecting her personally things such as what your donations can actually lead to or what impacts your donations currently have. </p>
			<blockquote>
        -'It would be great to show more community involvement rather than just money. Things such as volunteering opportunities or community dashboard would be a great start.'
			</blockquote>
      <h4>User profile 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 21</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li>
        <li><strong>Device viewed:</strong> iPad (Tablet)</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> Low</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interview was held for the website of AWC. The first thing to note about this user is that she has a very low interest in things related to animals as she mentioned her highest priority is people. Since her interest is low its no surprise that she has no relationship any wildlife organisations. However her feedback for the website very useful </p>
			<blockquote>
        -'I feel that this is definitely an important topic and needs to be addressed however my interest just isn't in animals but more on people.'
			</blockquote>
      <h4>User profile 3</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 24</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li>
        <li><strong>Device viewed:</strong> Desktop</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> Yes</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> High</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This user interview gave some very insightful reason as to why he has signed up to make a difference. Firstly he shared that his awareness of the entire issue is very high and he got this idea at a young age and this has allowed him continue helping out and donating especially during the bushfire season.</p>
			<blockquote>
        -'I take pity on those animals that lost their homes to the bushfires. Even the people that lost their homes. Its so saddening and something needs to be done to help them.'
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The structure of this website should be something that is simple, easy to follow and essentially no clutters along the page. For those younger generations overloading them with pointless information is not very useful as discovered by the user research. <strong>With this we wanted to make something interactive, <em>cool</em> and fun.</strong></p>
			<ul class='list-empty'>
				<li><strong>1. Navigation:</strong> People found that with the current website and even other websites relating to this issue there are a tons of information and the navigation is incredibly messy. Even when just opening the landing page the navigation bar is already cluttered with many many links.</li>
				<li><strong>2. Information hierarchy:</strong> Information hierarchy is an important issue to cover regarding the website. We need to prioritise the important information and leave the not so important information for the end. This means; <strong>call to actions and current issues should be at the top </strong> and extra information like news, blogs other issues should be at the bottom.</li>
				<li><strong>3. Interactivity:</strong> People found that an important aspect and call to action would be a sense of community and interactivity. This meant that things such as a communiity blog, messenger or posts section might be able to help build relationships among those that want to help. Also things such as a dashboard to show progress as a team and individual scale could be very useful in helping keep track of progress.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Navigation structure</h3>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div>
					<p>Very clearly here the navigation is kept as minimal as possible with three main functions (links):</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Home</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Topics</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Community</strong></li>
					</ul>
				<p>These functions will be the core of our website which should be how we navigate from the home page rather than opening the topics and having a large dropdown with many different topics. Instead we can open each individual pages and see more details from there.</p>
				</div>
				<img src="Assets/Images/navigation_structure.jpg" alt="Navigation stucture" class="reference-images"/>
				
			</div>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div>
					<p><strong>This would be the final navigation structure for this website.</strong></p>
					<ul class='navigation-list'>
						<li><strong>Home:</strong> this would be the landing page aimed to create the initial relationship with the users with the following important information: why we are donating, what their donations are going towards and how else they can help.</li>
						<li><strong>Topics:</strong> this would be the latest published blogs or news articles either presenting with good news or bad news. These cards can then open up to the full article but the main idea is to create curiousity within the user to want to learn more.</li>
						<li><strong>Feed:</strong> this will essentially be the bread and butter of this website. This is where users and general people can learn more about the topic from their own communities. People can post photos of them helping out and feel proud as well as share it with others on how they can help out too.</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
				</div>
				<img src="Assets/Images/Navigation_final.jpg" alt="Navigation final" class="reference-images"/>
			</div>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<h4><strong>Colour themes</strong></h3>
				<p>Colours for this website will be extremely important because it needs to be serious enough but also gain the attention of the younger generation. So with this I have went with flat ui colours from <a href="https://flatuicolors.com/palette/defo">here</a>.</p>
				<h4 class='theme-heading'><strong>Flat UI Colours (Vibrant & High Contrast)</strong></h4>
				<div class='theme-container'>
					<div class='color-container'>
						<div id='color1'></div>
						<p>#16a085</p>
					</div>
					<div class='color-container'>
						<div id='color2'></div>
						<p>#27ae60</p>
					</div>
					<div class='color-container'>
						<div id='color3'></div>
						<p>#2980b9</p>
					</div>
					<div class='color-container'>
						<div id='color4'></div>
						<p>#2c3e50</p>
					</div>
					<div class='color-container'>
						<div id='color5'></div>
						<p>#e74c3c</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>We are going to be strict on this colour palatte because so often many websites have a splash of different contrasting colours which don't highlight the importance of nature. We have two shades of green as this conveys the beauty in the natural habitat, another two blue shades that highlights the peace that nature actually brings and the red to highlight danger and importance.</p>
				<p>These colours go hand in hand to produce a vibrant website but also allows the colours to vectorise the viewers eyes. <strong>These colours would essentially capture the vibrant beauty of the rainforest.</strong></p>
				<h4 class='theme-heading'><strong>Natural Rugged Colours (Dull)</strong></h4>
					<div class='theme-container'>
						<div class='color-container'>
							<div id='color6'></div>
							<p>#724428</p>
						</div>
						<div class='color-container'>
							<div id='color7'></div>
							<p>#73584b</p>
						</div>
						<div class='color-container'>
							<div id='color8'></div>
							<p>#c59775</p>
						</div>
						<div class='color-container'>
							<div id='color9'></div>
							<p>#efeae6</p>
						</div>
						<div class='color-container'>
							<div id='color10'></div>
							<p>#85b7bc</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>This was another great colour palatte provided from <a href="https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-1688/"></a>. This colour palatte provides a more cool and highlights the natural look of the mountains. This draws the viewer into a relaxed headspace and just admire the beauty of nature. However using these colours means that the theme for the website would have to be mountains which could potentially be very <strong>limiting</strong>.</p>
			<h4><strong>Layout and styling</strong></h4>
			<p>This website would be based on a gridded structure like a gallery or in rows for the home page.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/ExampleOfGrid.png" alt="Example of grid">
				<figcaption>This is an example of gridding to display information. Screenshot from  <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/our-planet#gs.juhfws">WWF</a>.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This gridding structure to present current news and blogs from accredited scientists can allow easy navigation structure but more importantly <strong>only showing more information when the user wants to see it.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Illustrations and images</strong> we choose would include a lot of <em>cute</em>	animals to gain sympathy of the users as this is our main objective of the website. Keeping our target audience in mind as user feedback stated the reason that people actually come back to wildlife organisations is due to <strong>sympathy</strong> or <strong>guilt</strong> of human's destruction.</p>
			<p>Scouting around different websites relating to nature, beauty and wildlife; there are not many good templates or designs that suits our need to cater for the youths. Most of it are very basic layouts going down the page, very static and lacks of passion. With this in our designs we feel that the most important aspect to gain our target audience would be to stir an emotion for adventure.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/national_geographic_image.jpg" alt="National Geographic Image">
				<figcaption>This is an example from national geographic which was sourced from <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/40813940362799769/">pintrest</a></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This image provides a <strong>great</strong> example of how we can utilise complex gridding and the rugged colour scheme to portray a sense of adventure to appeal to the youths. This not only shows the beauty in the natural habitats and the reasons that we need to protect them but also allows our users to dive deeper into how far they can help out rather than just donating money.</p>
			<blockquote>'Although money is an important resource, saving our wildlife and environment takes a lot more than just money.'</blockquote>
			<p>One of the main target goals for this website is to gain new users and contributors but more importantly to <strong>retain</strong> these users.</p>
			<p>We asked around through the <strong>user research</strong> what would capture and what would allow these organisations to build a strong and lasting relationship and the most common answer for this is a sense of community. I got asked the question <em>'Would you rather volunteer alone or with your peers?'</em>. However very often it is difficult to find peers that want to help change the world as well so with this our platform will be designed to connect communities.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/UIUX_design.png" alt="Example of feed for UIUX designs">
				<figcaption>This is a great example of how we can let youths interact with each other. Youths these days are addicted to online communities such as discord, facebook, instagram the list goes on and on. What if we can create a positive online community for a change?</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>So in this sense; instead of a gaming community what if we created an educational and productive community where youths can share ideas on how to tackle this issue?</p>
			<h4><strong>Training</strong></h3>
				<p>Youths often want things that are more exciting and make a greater impact so with this training from professionals to boost the potential of our target users might be a good option.</p>
				<p><strong>Examples of trainings:</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Be Out There</li>
					<li>Let’s G.O. !</li>
					<li>REI Family Adventure Program</li>
					<li>Sierra Club Outdoors</li>
					<li>Ocean Guardian Classrooms</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We do not necessarily have to use these training programs but things like this can defintiely build a strong passion for the environment in general for kids/youths/teenagers.</p>
				<blockquote>'Getting kids to engage with the natural world in a meaningful way should not involve the feeling of disconnect and superiority that comes with feeding peanuts to an elephant through wrought-iron gates. We need our children to respect animals and the natural world, a task that really can’t be done through the guise of water parks and exotic animal souvenirs.' - Kate Good</blockquote>

			<h4><strong>Landing page layout</strong></h4>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/Landing_page_sketch.jpg" alt="Landing page sketch">
				<figcaption><strong>Option 1: </strong>This shows the clear information hierarchy as mentioned in the initial basis for our design.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h4>Reasonings for landing page layout</h4>
			<ul class='list-styles'>
				<li>We want to include more images, less words but keep a clear structure for the information in order of importance.</li>
				<li>The top row would be our navigation bar. Keeping the navigation bar as minimal as possible is cruicial because we do <strong>not</strong> want to scare away potential users by overloading them with information</li>
				<li>We want to build emotions within our target audience rather than constantly trying to get donations.</li>
				<li>In the last section we want to include buttons and call to actions. Although this is the most important aspect of the landing page it is not something that we want our users to see right from the start. Rather they would need reasoning to actually access these call to actions. The three call to actions would include: Donate, volunteer and join community.</li>
				<li>Placeholder images would be replaced with infographics and community photos.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4><strong>Community page</strong></h4>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/Community_example.jpg" alt="Example of community dashboard for interactions">
				<figcaption><strong>Option 1:</strong> Quick sketch of how the dashboard should look like to be inclusive as well as to build strong community bonds. This is an extremely important aspect of our platform and website.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><em>A feedback from this particular dashboard is that its quite messy and cluttered. Potential users said that these can get very overwhelming just looking at it even if its catered towards the younger generation. They said we need to be more inclusive.</em></p>
			<h4>Reasonings for community page layout</h4>
			<ul class='list-styles'>
				<li>Similar to the home page the top will be the navigation bar.</li>
				<li>Looks slightly cluttered on purpose to seem like more things is happening to keep the users engaged.</li>
				<li>Left column is for the notifcations so the users can keep updated with their friends, community groups and even upcoming events</li>
				<li>Middle column would be the dashboard. <strong>According to user interviews</strong> people like to keep track of their current accomplishments and how they can improve.</li>
				<li>Right column would be for both community feeds and friends feed. This allows users to see what is going on around thier area, current events or events that their friends are planning to join.</li>
				<li>Two call to action buttons for finding friends and finding communities to join!</li>
			</ul>
			<figure>
				<img src="Assets/Moodboard-images/Community_Sketch.jpg" alt="Second option for dashboard section of website">
				<figcaption><strong>Option 2:</strong> Different layout for community section for webasite. Does this allow for users to connect easily with each other without the clutter?</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><em>This got much better feedback from potential users as this allowed the users to easily navigate through the website top down. Instead of the initial sketch which was left to right.</em></p>
			<h4>Reasonings for option 2 of community page layout</h4>
			<ul class='list-styles'>
				<li>Top down and expandable dashboard might make it easier for users to navigate through the page without feeling intimidated.</li>
				<li>We don't want this platform to take over people's lives like social media but should be a quick way for users to find like minded people.</li>
				<li>Easily find top events attending or even events that friends are going/planning to attend.</li>
				<li>Bottom navigation bar seems easy to understand.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4><strong>Overall feedback from sketches:</strong></h4>
			<p>These initial sketches give a very good first impression to how the structure is going to be like. This shows the starting ideas of how we are going to layout all the required information. Remember from the initial background research we wanted to show only the relevant information to our target audience rather than throw <strong>all the information at our users</strong>. This will give our foundation the best chance to build that initial relationship with our platform and bring upon positive change that will hopefully affect <strong>generations</strong>.</p>
