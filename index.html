      <h3 id="topic">The topic</h3>
      <p>The Australian wildlife has been degrading for as long as humans have been on this planet. Although due to the increasing population there is no possible way for us to completely save the Earth and its animals from degrading but we CAN build awareness on how to reduce pollution and further damages to the wildlife. These wildlife organisations are necessary to build a future where humans can live in harmony with nature. In Australia there are many threats to our current ecosystem such as pollution, bushfires and reef and coral damages. All of these issues have grave impacts on our current habitats and natural wildlifes for generations to come. With this said the purpose of this website would be to raise awareness and build the concern for <strong>our</strong> environment especially with the younger generations.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>The <strong>AWC</strong> -(Australian Wildlife Conservatory) is currently the largest private owner and manager of land of conservation in Australia. They are strong believers that currently the ways Australia is managing wildlife conservations is inadequte and they are developing and implementing a new model of conservation.</p>

      <h4>Target audience</h4>
			<p>Wildlife conservations should be a world wide topic however the issue now is that the urgency is not built as part of a culture in Australia currently. The main goal of this website would be to capture the attention of the younger generation especially youths <em>(Between the ages of 15-24)</em> and attempt to build the relationship between wildlife organisations and these people to build a better and brighter culture for the future.</p>
      <!-- Use the blockquote element if applicable -->
      <h4>Why this re-design is needed</h4>
      <p>Currently a lot of the wildlife conservatories including WWF and the current AWC websites are either too vague or too broad. There is no balance of information but for WWF's website it is far too cluttered with so many different topics being presented, which for their purpose would be good as they are targetting a wide range of audiences.And in the case of AWC there is a lack of vital information such as where people's donation money is going or even the main issues they are trying to solve!</p>
      <h4>User profile 1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 19</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li>
        <li><strong>Favourite device:</strong> Laptop</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> High</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interview was held for the website of AWC. The first thing to note is that this particular user has a strong understanding and interest in animals and the natural wildlife however she has no relationship with any of the wildlife organisations. We were keen to find out why and how have these organisations missed this user. When this question was presented the answer was not surprising; she simply had not enough awareness of the direness of this situation. This brought up an interesting topic where when she browsed the website there was no call for action and had a poor navigation hierarchy and it seems informative but does not actually encourage anyone to help out. Instead it would be better to show something that is affecting her personally things such as what your donations can actually lead to or what impacts your donations currently have. </p>
			<blockquote>
        'It would be great to show more community involvement rather than just money. Things such as volunteering opportunities or community dashboard would be a great start.'
			</blockquote>
      <h4>User profile 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 21</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li>
        <li><strong>Device viewed:</strong> iPad (Tablet)</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with any wildlife organisations:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in topic:</strong> Low</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interview was held for the website of AWC. The first thing to note about this user is that she has a very low interest in things related to animals as she mentioned her highest priority is people. Since her interest is low its no surprise that she has no relationship any wildlife organisations. However her feedback for the website very useful </p>
			<blockquote>
        'I feel that this is definitely an important topic and needs to be addressed however my interest just isn't in animals but more on people.'

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The structure of this website should be something that is simple, easy to follow and essentially no clutters along the page. For those younger generations overloading them with pointless information is not very useful as discovered by the user research. <strong>With this we wanted to make something interactive, <em>cool</em> and fun.</strong></p>
			<ul class='list-empty'>
				<li><strong>1. Navigation:</strong> People found that with the current website and even other websites relating to this issue there are a tons of information and the navigation is incredibly messy. Even when just opening the landing page the navigation bar is already cluttered with many many links.</li>
				<li><strong>2. Information hierarchy:</strong> Information hierarchy is an important issue to cover regarding the website. We need to prioritise the important information and leave the not so important information for the end. This means; <strong>call to actions and current issues should be at the top </strong> and extra information like news, blogs other issues should be at the bottom.</li>
				<li><strong>3. Interactivity:</strong> People found that an important aspect and call to action would be a sense of community and interactivity. This meant that things such as a communiity blog, messenger or posts section might be able to help build relationships among those that want to help. Also things such as a dashboard to show progress as a team and individual scale could be very useful in helping keep track of progress.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Navigation structure</h3>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div>
					<p>Very clearly here the navigation is kept as minimal as possible with three main functions (links):</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Home</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Topics</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Community</strong></li>
					</ul>
				<p>These functions will be the core of our website which should be how we navigate from the home page rather than opening the topics and having a large dropdown with many different topics. Instead we can open each individual pages and see more details from there.</p>
				</div>
				<img src="Assets/Images/navigation_structure.jpg" alt="Navigation stucture" class="reference-images"/>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div>
					<p><strong>This would be the final navigation structure for this website.</strong></p>
					<ul class='navigation-list'>
						<li><strong>Home:</strong> this would be the landing page aimed to create the initial relationship with the users with the following important information: why we are donating, what their donations are going towards and how else they can help.</li>
						<li><strong>Topics:</strong> this would be the latest published blogs or news articles either presenting with good news or bad news. These cards can then open up to the full article but the main idea is to create curiousity within the user to want to learn more.</li>
						<li><strong>Feed:</strong> this will essentially be the bread and butter of this website. This is where users and general people can learn more about the topic from their own communities. People can post photos of them helping out and feel proud as well as share it with others on how they can help out too.</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>

				<img src="Assets/Images/Navigation_final.jpg" alt="Navigation final" class="reference-images"/>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>The over arching theme for this website should be colourful and vibrant. And everything should be in grids. Especially the cards and overall navigation of the website should be in grids or nested grids.</p>
